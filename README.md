Create a New AI Mock Interview
When the user clicks "+ Add new Interview" from the Dashboard, a modal form appears to gather basic information about the user's job profile. This information helps the system generate a personalized mock interview session.

ðŸ“‹ Modal Form Fields:

Job Role / Job Position:

Example: Full Stack Developer, Data Analyst, DevOps Engineer

This helps the AI tailor the questions based on the job role.

Job Description / Tech Stack:

Enter relevant technologies or responsibilities.

Example: React, Node.js, MongoDB, or Cloud deployment, Docker, Kubernetes

Year of Experience:

Number of years the candidate has worked in the specified role.

This helps scale the complexity of the questions (e.g., basic for 1 year, advanced for 5+ years).

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

Once the user fills out this information and clicks Start Interview, the app initiates a mock interview experience using the provided inputs, simulating real-world technical or HR-style questions.

This approach ensures that every interview session is customized, making it highly relevant for practice or preparation.
